# EIGENVALUES-AND-EIGENVECTORS
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the Eigenvalues and Eigen Vectors
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step1 : 

Start the program and import the NumPy library to perform matrix operations such as eigenvalue and eigenvector computation.

### Step 2: 

Define the given matrix by storing its elements in a NumPy array.

### Step 3:

Using the np.linalg.eig(),  we get two results (first is eigenvalue and second is eigenvector) of the given matrix.

### Step 4: 

Display the eigenvalues and eigenvectors by printing the results on the screen.

## Program:

## Result:
Thus the Eigenvalue and Eigenvector is successfully solved using python program
